Localhost Development Site
==========================

The Localhost Development Site is a simple application I use to help corral my web apps. It reads your development webroot and generates a table of searchable, filterable table of your projects. The app uses Twitter Bootstrap UI, jQuery, and DataTables.

Installation
------------

Simply drop this project in your local webroot, and drop your apps inside it.
