Local Development Project Filter
================================

History
-------

I often find myself working on dozens of web applications, using different operating systems and platforms in different coding languages at a time.  Over time, I found that a simple landing page that allowed me to quickly filter and find the project or utility helped me immensely.

Overview
--------

Requirements
-----

Apache
PHP

Todo
----

Create a simple function to read the current URL so we don't have to rely on editing the config file out of the box.
